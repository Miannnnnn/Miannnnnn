Hi, I'm Miannnnnn and I speak Spanish and a little English, but you can call me whatever you want.
I'm interested in web development, so I'm currently learning technologies like Css and JavaScript.
And not only am I interested in Web Development but I am also here to make friends (if I have a social life by the way)
and if you like, you can write to me and we can talk for a while.
